# Phlexiful
Phlexiful is very much a WIP, but here's what it contains so far!
- Media Catcher: A leggings item that slowly gains media, up to a small cap
- Casting Hood: A hood to keep those pesky hexcasting particles from blinding you
- Annihilate Block: Break Block, but cheaper, greater, and no tiledrops.

Much is planned, among those plans is a forge release.
